# About
This was one of my final assignments back in College. Using Ruby on Rails, this is a Custom Mechanical Keyboard E-Commerce store. The website was able to create backend invoices for customer products and take in payments for processing.

The website consists of gems such as:
Kaminari: for Pagination
Active Admin: for a Administrative Interface
SQLite3: as the database
Stripe: for backend payment processing
